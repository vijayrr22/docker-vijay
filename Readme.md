3.1. BERT Models for Arabic Language
BERT is implemented using a transformer, a sizeable part that processes sequence
input using an encoder and generates an expectation for the task using a decoder. Only
the encoder portion of BERT is implemented in order to create a language representation
model. BERT accepts a single sequence for embedding and tagging or a pair of sequences
for classification as its input. Two further tokens are added at the start (CLS) and end (SEP)
of the tokenized sentence before feeding to BERT. By adding a further layer (or layers)
on top of BERT, and processing all of the layers at once, BERT can be improved while
using fewer resources for downstream NLP tasks. The fundamental BERT architecture was
trained in a variety of languages.
There are several reasons why the use of BERT would be justified in the proposed
study. Firstly, BERT has been specifically designed to handle the complexities of NLP
and has achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks. This makes it a
strong candidate for use in the study, particularly given that the study is focused on Arabic
language processing. Moreover, BERT has multiple Arabic versions that have been trained
on large Arabic language corpora, which gives it the ability to capture the nuances and
characteristics of the Arabic language. This is important because the specific characteristics
of a language can significantly impact the performance of a language model, and using a
model that has been trained on a similar language can improve its performance.
As highlighted above, there are a number of different BERT versions dedicated to the
Arabic language. With 768 hidden dimensions, 12 blocks of the transformer, 12 attention
heads, and a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens, Arabic BERT [19] employed the
standard setup of BERT. CAMeLBERT [20] was developed as a collection of BERT models
that have already been pre-trained on Arabic texts of various sizes and types (modern
standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic (DA), classic Arabic (CA) and a mix of the three).
Similarly, the BERT base configuration was utilized by ARABERT [21]. MARBERT [22]
is another large masked and pre-trained language model focused on both MSA and DA.
mBERT [7] is a multilingual extension of BERT, which is trained on Wikipedia monolingual
corpora in 104 languages, including Arabic.
3.2. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) Layer
Strong dependencies between labels must be taken into account in sequence-labelling
tasks such as aspect extraction. While BiLSTM or BiGRU can account for long-term context
information, they are unable to account for tag dependency while generating output results.
These issues can be addressed through CRF. With highly interdependent output labels, the
CRF layer is used. Labelling choices are collaboratively modelled with a CRF layer rather
than individually, with the goal of producing the best possible global sequence of labels
from an input sequence.
Conceptually, conditional random fields are an undirected graphical model for se-
quence labelling. CRFs can also model a much richer set of label distributions because they
can define a much larger set of features, and CRFs can have arbitrary weights. Mathemati-
cally, CRF can be stated as follows. Following [1,23], we denote by X = (x1, x2, . . . , xN) a
given input sequence, and by Y = (y1, y2, . . . , yN) the corresponding tag sequence.
The following is the formula for a y label sequence’s conditional probability given a
sequence x [24]:
pλ,µ(x|y) = 1
Z(x)
·
n
∏
i=1
exp(λyi−1yi + µyi
· xi)
where x is a feature vector such that xi ∈ R
m, µ is a matrix of size |Y| × m, λ is a matrix of
|Y| × |Y|, µyi
is the ith row in the matrix µ, and Z(x) is a normalization constant known
as a partition function [25]. In the equation, λyi−1yi
is a transition score that represents the
score of a transition from the tag yi−1
to the tag yi
. The term µyi
.xi
is an emission score that
refers to the score of the tag yi of the word xi
. To estimate the parameters (λ, µ), we use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The Viterbi [26] algorithm is used by the model
during testing to predict the best-scoring tag sequence.

3.3. Proposed Fine-Grained Annotation of Arabic Dataset (HAAD)

The BIO scheme is widely employed for labelling words in an ATE task where B stands
for the beginning of an aspect, I stands for inside an aspect, and O stands for outside an
aspect, i.e., just a regular word. In this study, we used a more fine-grained annotation which
jointly takes into consideration the aspect term extraction and its polarity classification
(B-Positive, B-Negative, B-Conflict, B-Neutral, I-Positive, I-Negative, I-Conflict, I-Neutral,
O). The biggest benefit of CRF is that it automatically picks up on some constraints for
output labels that adhere to the BIO labelling scheme, which helps to validate predicted
sequence labels. While learning, these restrictions are automatically learned. The following
are some examples of these constraints in the context of our ATE task [1]: The opening
prediction label may read ‘B-Positive’ or ‘O’, but not ‘I-Positive’. The ‘O I-Positive’ pattern
is not valid because ‘I-Positive’ should come before ‘B-Positive’. The ‘B-Negative I-Positive’
pattern is invalid because of ‘I-Positive’, and ‘I-Positive’ should be preceded by ‘B-Positive’.
3.4. Proposed Joint Model
In this paper, we jointly solve the ATE and APD tasks. Figure 1 shows the proposed
architecture. First, the input sentence is tokenized with the associated BERT tokenizer to
ensure the text is split the same way as the pre-training corpus and minimize the out-of-
vocabulary terms. BERT requires input sentences of the same length with a maximum of
512 tokens. Thus, for short sentences, special [PAD] tokens are added to make sentences of
equal length. BERT outputs the hidden state or the encoding vector corresponding to each
token, including the special tokens. Then, these inputs are fed to a fully connected layer
followed by the linear-chain CRF layer that jointly outputs the aspect and the polarity. The
goal of CRF is to create a dependency between successive labels or aspects and to ensure
the validity of the aspect sequence.
ChatGPT
It seems like you've provided a detailed overview of using BERT models for Arabic language processing, particularly for tasks like aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity detection (APD). BERT's architecture, along with its various versions trained specifically for Arabic, offers a strong foundation for such tasks. Additionally, incorporating a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer further enhances the model's ability to capture label dependencies, crucial for sequence labeling tasks like ATE. The fine-grained annotation scheme, coupled with the joint modeling approach combining BERT and CRF, presents a robust solution for ATE and APD in Arabic text.

ChatGPT
Of course! Here's a simpler explanation:

BERT for Arabic Text: BERT is a smart system that understands Arabic text well. It reads sentences or pairs of sentences and can learn a lot about them. It's been trained on lots of Arabic text to understand the language better.
Why BERT Works: BERT is great for understanding Arabic because it's built specifically for handling language tasks like understanding meaning and context. Plus, there are different versions of BERT made just for Arabic, so it knows all the ins and outs of the language.
Making BERT Even Better: People have figured out ways to make BERT even smarter for specific tasks like finding important terms in sentences and figuring out their positive or negative meanings. They've added extra layers to BERT to help it do these jobs better.
Using CRF for Labeling: To help BERT figure out which words are important and what they mean, they use something called Conditional Random Fields (CRF). CRF helps BERT understand how words are connected in a sentence and what role each word plays.
Putting it All Together: They've come up with a plan to use BERT and CRF together to understand Arabic text even better. First, they break down the text into small pieces and feed it to BERT. Then, they use CRF to help BERT figure out which words are important and how they fit together in the sentence. This way, BERT can not only understand Arabic text but also pick out important terms and understand their meanings.
